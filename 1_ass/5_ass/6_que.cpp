// 1. Create a base class Student(Roll_No, Name, Class) which derives two classes 
// Internal_Marks(IntM1, IntM2, IntM3, IntM4, IntM5) and External_Marks(ExtM1 ExtM2, 
// ExtM3, ExtM4, ExtM5). Class Result(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) inherits both Internal_Marks 
// and External_Marks classes. (Use Virtual Base Class)

// i. To Accept and display student details
// ii. Calculate Subject wise total marks obtained. 
// iii.Check whether student has passed in Internal and External Exam of each subject.

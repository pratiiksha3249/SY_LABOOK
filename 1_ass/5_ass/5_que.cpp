// Create a base class Student(Roll_No, Name) which derives two classes 
// Academic_Marks(Mark1, Mark2, Mark3) and Extra_Activities_Marks(Marks). Class 
// Result(Total_Marks, Grade) inherits both Academic_Marks and Extra_Activities_Marks 
// classes. (Use Virtual Base Class)
//  Write a C++ menu driven program to perform the following functions:
// i. Build a master table.
// ii. Calculate Total_marks and grade
